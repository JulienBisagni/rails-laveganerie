    description: `When most of us hear the word "steak," a big slab of cauliflower isn't the first thing that comes to mind. But if the pros in the Good Housekeeping Test Kitchen have anything to do with it, that's about to change: This hearty cauliflower steak recipe is a vegetarian dinner alternative that even the staunchest of meat-eaters will love.

    The best part about these steaks: They only takes 20 minutes to make, so it's easy to whip them up alongside a turkey on Thanksgiving Day or as a quick and easy weeknight dinner. Just follow our experts' tips and dig in:

    Cut your cauliflower with care. If you want to end up with a true cauliflower "steak," you'll need the vegetable to maintain its shape. Watch the video above to see what we mean.
    Find ways to use the leftover cauliflower. Pulse the extra pieces in a food processor to make your own cauliflower rice, or chop 'em into bite-size florets for roasting.
    Get creative. This simple recipe gives so many opportunities to play with flavors: You can coat your cauliflower with any combo of herbs and spices, such as rosemary and black pepper, curry powder, or lemon zest. And depending on your rub, you can switch up your sauce: tzatziki, pesto, chutney, or creamy horseradish would all be tasty.`,
